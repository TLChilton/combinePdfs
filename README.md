# combinePdfs

A simple program for combining PDFs within a folder that I created for my buddy Shawn

## Potential things to add:

* A way to specify which pdfs to combine
* The ability to handle encrypted files
  * Currently these are excepted and ignored
  * In the future a prompt could be added asking if they should be included
  * A password would be asked for and then the ensuing combined PDF would then also be encrypted

## Usage: 

Simply move the .exe file into the folder that contains your pdfs. Run the .exe and it will combine the pdfs.
The program allows you to specify the file name of the ensuing file.
